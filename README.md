Website Blocker final project by Gavin Glinecke

Idea: Website Blocker using only Python

My idea stems from my job between semesters at an MSP where I sometimes help systems analysts. My last day, before this semester, a company asked us to restrict
a specific PC's websites because a security guard was watching too much Crunchyroll(nice). But, I didn't get to work on it since it was brought to me about an hour before I left for school. A coworker said it can be done by blocking the domain name from your IP.
